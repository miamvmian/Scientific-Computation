The program must be callable in the form `mpirun -np <N> python linecount.py` (in the case of the Python version) or `mpirun -np <N> linecount.exe` (the C/C++ version), where `<N>` is the user-defined number of processes. The program is expected to first somehow distribute the files found in the current directory to the processes, then each process should count the lines in the files assigned to it, and finally the result should be MPI-reduced and printed out. The program only needs to output **the number of lines in the largest file**; no need to output the name of this file. The program must work correctly even if the number of files is not divisible by the number of processes.\n",

Assume that each student $(k)_{k=0}^{N-1}$ has a list of his/her preferences for the projects, expressed as a vector $\\mathbf r_k$ of integer ranks assigned to each project. Ranks vary between 0 and $N-1$ without repetitions, the **lower** the rank the **more preferable** the project. (For example, the first student's ranks are $\\mathbf r_0 = [2,1,0]$, the second's $\\mathbf r_1 = [0,2,1]$ and the third $\\mathbf r_2 = [0,1,2]$). We want to distribute the projects so as to maximize the total preference, i.e., if $n_k$ denotes the project assigned to the $k$'th student, we want to make $f = \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \\mathbf r_k[n_k]$ as small as possible. (In the example above the optimal distribution is $n_0=2, n_1=0, n_2=1$, which gives $f=1$).  \n",

The algorithm should accept the preference vectors and output a recommended distribution $(n_k)_{k=1}^N$. The algorithm need not find the best solution, but is expected to generally produce better solutions than would have been obtained by randomly distributing the projects. The algorithm should be reasonably fast, say run in not more than a few seconds for $N=30$.\n",

To this end, perform $M=1000$ experiments in each of which 1) random preference vectors for $N=30$ students and projects are generated; 2) the objective function $f$ is evaluated for both algorithms. After finishing all the experiments, plot the two respective distributions of the obtained $M$ values of $f$ and compute the mean values of $f$ for both algorithms.\n",

We observe that in more than 99% of such experiments we obtain $r < 10^{-5}$. Does this observation contradict the hypothesis of generating independent uniformly distributed random numbers?
